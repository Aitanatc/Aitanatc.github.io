                <h2>Know more about Cozumel Islands</h2>
                <img src="assets/cozumel.jpg" alt="Cozumel Islands">
                <article>Clear, warm water, spectacular coral reefs, and abundant marine life make Cozumel one of the world’s best scuba-diving destinations as well as a major resort. Indeed, the economy of Cozumel has been based on tourism since the 1970s. In addition to the diving opportunities, other water sports, and fishing, tourists are attracted by Cozumel’s tropical climate, sand beaches, and duty-free port shopping, along with its atmosphere, which is more relaxed than that of nearby Cancún. Substantial resort development on the island’s protected western coast extends both north and south from the island’s main town and commercial centre, San Miguel de Cozumel. Chankanaab National Park, just south of San Miguel, has a museum, botanic garden, and archaeological park. Cruise ships dock regularly at a pier south of San Miguel. Cozumel has regular ferry service from Playa del Carmen and Puerto Morelos. An international airport is located 2 miles (3 km) south of San Miguel.</article>

                    <h3>San Miguel de Cozumel</h3>
                    <p>San Miguel de Cozumel. It is a hub for tourism on the Riviera Maya, providing the sole ferries between the Mexican mainland and the island. In addition to the ferry service to Playa del Carmen, the first international cruise terminal in Quintana Roo is located in the city.
                        The International Pier has an international cruise wharf of 271 meters and a dolphin at 45 meters, giving it the ability to receive two cruise ships at once: the exterior band can receive voyager class ships of 140,000 displacement tons, and the interior band can receive ships up to 85,000 displacement tons. A tender wharf is used to receive minor boats at the terminal.</p>

                    <h3>El Cedral Ruinas in Cozumel</h3>
                    <p>El Cedral is the oldest Mayan Ruins on Cozumel Island, dating back to 800 A.D.  The Mayan village was once the capital of Cozumel, and the largest community on the island.  It was discovered by Spanish Conquistadors in 1518, who tore down much of the Mayan temple, and then during World War II, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers destroyed more of it to make way for the island's first airport.  Today, there is not much of this once significant Mayan temple remaining, but you can see a portion of it, and with the help of one of our knowledgeable guides, you can picture the community as it once existed - as the hub of Mayan life in Cozumel.</p>

                    <h3>Laguna Chankanaab - Marine Park</h3>
                    <p>One of the most interesting natural attractions on Cozumel is Laguna Chankanaab, a small freshwater lake just six kilometers south of San Miguel de Cozumel in the National Marine Park. Cut off from the sea (apart from a number of underground channels), it's a popular place to visit thanks to its crystal-clear water and numerous colorful tropical fish, and is an enchanting place to swim, snorkel, and scuba dive.
                        Here guests can enjoy activities including a sea lion show, a dolphin swim experience, and a crocodile exhibition. Other fun things to do include ziplining and treetop climbing, as well as a visit to an authentic Mayan home to sample traditional foods.</p>
